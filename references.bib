The novelty of our approach is that we do not use regular workstations or laptops to host the AR (augmented reality) application. Instead we use fully autonomous PDAs, running the application together with an optical marker-based tracking module that makes this application not only available for a broad audience but also optimally mobile.},

To explore this, I designed Reliving the Revolution (RtR) as a novel model for evaluating educational AR games. RtR takes place in Lexington, Massachusetts, the site of the Battle of Lexington. Participants interact with virtual historic ﬁgures and items, which are triggered by GPS to appear on their PDA (personal digital assistant) depending on where they are standing in Lexington. Game participants receive differing evidence, as appropriate for their role in the game (Minuteman soldier, Loyalist, African American soldier, or British soldier), and use this information to decide who ﬁred the ﬁrst shot at the Battle. Results of initial trials of RtR suggest that AR games, when properly designed for pedagogical purposes, can motivate the authentic practice of 21st century skills.},

A comparative trial was run with a non-AR digital system. Analyses of videos, field notes, interviews, questionnaires and user-created content expose phenomena that arise uniquely when using AR maps in the wild. We report on how augmentation affects the way participants use their body and hands, manipulate the mobile device in tandem with the physical map, walk while using, and collaborate. We found that the MapLens solution facilitates place-making by its constant need for referencing to the physical, and in that it also allows for ease of bodily configurations for the group, encourages establishment of common ground, and thereby invites discussion, negotiation and public problem-solving. Its main potential lies not so much in use for navigation but in use as a collaborative tool.},

What is even more important is that information must be relevant to the user and presented in such a manner that it is easily understood. Emerging technologies, such as augmented reality (AR) might within short period of time be widely accepted, as smart-phones are today. If this happens, it will probably change the way we perceive information and our reality. AR is not hype any more - it is a solid technology that is already used in some creative applications. One area which might significantly benefit in the future from this technology is the education process. AR tools could guide students through learning process in enhanced way, as AR can upgrade traditional books with a digital layer. We think it will improve both, teaching and learning experience, and bring interactive dimension into the whole picture. We also predict that this new layer will encompass several senses which could speed up memorization process. Furthermore, AR learning method might raise common understanding of the learning material. Moreover, learning activities could be supervised by a mentor or automated process which might also lead to a lower school dropout rate. Our still-in-progress ARAVET project is exploring mentioned predictions about AR learning method. We will present the results we have so far.},

The film uses the concepts of Spatial Mapping, Spatial Understanding, Spatial Audio, and World Anchors to place multiple scenes on the viewer's actual surroundings; and dynamically changes the storyline based on the objects in the room. ARnold takes these technological opportunities and applies them to traditional storytelling techniques to create a film that is uniquely suited for MR. The main purpose of this project was to explore whether telling personalized experiences with a viewer-chosen setting increases empathy and creates a deeper emotional connection with the story. This paper also discusses the technical limitations of Microsoft HoloLens along the lines of how it affected our entire development cycle and the different techniques we adopted to tackle this challenge. This paper provides a detailed overview of our entire development cycle from both a technical and creative standpoint.},

Striving to be completely portable, these devices unfortunately suffer multiple limitations, such as the lack of real-time, high quality depth data, which severely restricts their use as research tools. To mitigate this restriction, we provide a simple method to augment a HoloLens headset with much higher resolution depth data. To do so, we calibrate an external depth sensor connected to a computer stick that communicates with the HoloLens headset in real-time. To show how this system could be useful to the research community, we present an implementation of small object detection on HoloLens device.},

The results show that HoloLens is able to estimate head posture more correctly at low movement speeds, reconstruct the environment most precisely for a flat surface under bright conditions, anchor augmented contents at desired locations most accurately at distances of 1.5 m and 2.5 m, display objects with an average size error of 6.64\%, and recognize speech commands with correctness rates of 74.47\% and 66.87\% for userdefined and system-defined commands, respectively.

Data gathered from a longitudinal study about museum learning practice and from a semester-long investigation, conducted with circa 60 Multimedia design students, reveal that non-linear narrative is seen as difficult to create and can be met by scepticism. On the other hand, adoption of non-linear narratives as pedagogical material and as students' assignments, elicits dialogue, critical reflections, and designerly forms of learning. However, non-linearity appears to clash with current assessment techniques, as institutional requirements demand linear narratives in education, both in relation to pedagogical material (textbooks) as well as students' assessment (essays and dissertations). Even the latest developments in presentation tools do not offer valid support for non-linear stories. An alternative approach is proposed here, that aims at easing authoring, use and assessment of non-linear narratives by means of a pattern language and measures of non-linearity inspired by social network analysis.},

A typical approach aims at generating narratives from baseline action representations, most often using planning techniques. However, this research has developed empirically, often as an application of planning. In this paper, we explore a more rigorous formalisation of narrative concepts, both at the action level and at the plot level. Our aim is to investigate how to bridge the gap between action descriptions and narrative concepts, by considering the latter from the perspective of resource consumption and causality. We propose to use Linear Logic, often introduced as a logic of resources, for it provides, through linear implication, a better description of causality than in Classical and Intuitionistic Logic. Besides advances in the fundamental principles of narrative formalisation, this approach can support the formal validation of scenario description as a preliminary step to their implementation via other computational formalisms.},

However, complicated installation issues persist, such as projection system installation and space setup to provide projection under various environments. In this study, we propose a portable, ambient projection system to address such complex installation issues. We defined pervasive projection AR system that enables projection in various spaces. The system consists of a pico-projector, a depth-sensing camera, and a pan/tilting platform that supports the projector-camera system. The portable ambient projection system can be positioned at an unknown space and can extract plane information by scanning its surrounding environment as it rotates 360-degrees in a clockwise manner. Users are provided with a pervasive projection AR environment as with a simple tablet user interface to control it.},

	doi = {10.1109/ISECon.2018.8340495},
	abstract = {Many jobs require the ability to collaborate effectively in teams, and STEM jobs are no exception. However, few curricula have been published that are explicitly designed to help undergraduates in STEM fields internalize the skills that are central to effective collaborative work. Students are typically assumed to be able to acquire these skills on their own. But when students without training are assigned to work in teams, they are no more likely to learn effective group process skills than if they were assigned a golf club and told to go figure out how to golf. In fact, without appropriate instruction and feedback, students typically develop counterproductive habits and attitudes, such as avoiding conflict, that undercut the effectiveness of a team. In this work-in-progress paper, I describe a curricular approach that has helped my students learn how to use teams in efficient, effective ways. It allows students to practice individual skills one at a time but also presents integrative team challenges that force them to decide how and when to apply specific group process skills and strategies. These challenges consist of 90-minute scavenger hunt or escape room-like puzzles that can only be completed within the time limit if students make efficient use of their assigned teams. Students describe these ungraded puzzles as anxiety-provoking but fun, and their progressive improvement over five once-a-week puzzles suggests that they internalize effective communication skills and learn ways of efficiently using teams to solve problems.},

The game is a multi-player team challenge based on the concept of an escape room, staged in a space colony emergency situation. An explorative empirical pre-post measurement study was carried out to establish whether playing AMELIO influences team cohesiveness. Ten teams of three played AMELIO and filled out pre- and post-game questionnaires with validated measurements of team cohesiveness and mediating factors related to team composition, game experience and team dynamics. The findings show a positive and significant increase in team cohesiveness, with stronger effects for teams with lower pre-game familiarity. In terms of game experience and team dynamics, audio aesthetics and empathy proved to be significant mediating factors. This aids game validation and improvement, and understanding and guiding the team building process.},

Objects can be placed in a remote room as well as in the user's room, and can also be moved around in a room. The user can therefore control equipment or interact with objects anywhere through the display of the system by combining images from local and remote places translucently. Our demonstration shows how the interface makes it easy to establish contact with movable objects in a remote room by "touching" them in the display.},

We conducted an observational and interview study with 38 escape room players to understand how groups of people collaborate in escape rooms, what opportunities escape rooms present as learning environments for improving collaboration, and how the design of escape rooms affects collaboration. Our results show that escape rooms provide people with opportunities to practice a range of collaboration skills, yet not all generalize to real world collaborative situations outside of the escape room. Thus, people may have an opportunity to practice communicating and maintaining an awareness of others, but the design of the room restricts such behaviors. These findings raise design opportunities for future escape rooms related to team dynamics and roles, the acquisition of situational and workspace awareness, and the teaching of conflict resolution techniques.},

	abstract = {We implemented live-textured geometry model creation with immediate coverage feedback visualizations in AR on the Microsoft HoloLens. A user walking and looking around a physical space can create a textured model of the space, ready for remote exploration and AR collaboration. Out of the box, a HoloLens builds a triangle mesh of the environment while scanning and being tracked in a new environment. The mesh contains vertices, triangles, and normals, but not color. We take the video stream from the color camera and use it to color a UV texture to be mapped to the mesh. Due to the limited graphics memory of the HoloLens, we use a fixed-size texture. Since the mesh generation dynamically changes in real time, we use an adaptive mapping scheme that evenly distributes every triangle of the dynamic mesh onto the fixed-size texture and adapts to new geometry without compromising existing color data. Occlusion is also considered. The user can walk around their environment and continuously fill in the texture while growing the mesh in real-time. We describe our texture generation algorithm and illustrate benefits and limitations of our system with example modeling sessions. Having first-person immediate AR feedback on the quality of modeled physical infrastructure, both in terms of mesh resolution and texture quality, helps the creation of high-quality colored meshes with this standalone wireless device and a fixed memory footprint in real-time.},

We explored the design of a distributed escape room that connected two distanceseparated rooms through audio/video links and shared artifacts. We evaluated it with pairs of participants to explore the design factors that affected player experiences. Results show that an audio connection created feelings of social presence. Video links augmented this connection to help players share knowledge and artifacts, however, showing less over the video feed created curiosity. Players expected a parallel setup between artifacts and puzzles in the rooms, despite the rooms being designed to vary in similarity and how closely players needed to collaborate. These results suggest directions for the design of audio connections to represent remote players, video feeds for sharing artifacts and promoting curiosity, and the use of both similar and dissimilar artifacts as a part of puzzles.},

To encourage a greater discussion on the potential benefits and challenges of a more holistic approach to developing GBL that promote human centered interactions and play for learning, the authors present the escapED programme. The escapED programme was conceived following the recent entertainment trend of escape rooms and is used for developing nondigital GBL approaches within education. escapED aids the design and creation of educational Escape Rooms and Interactive Gaming Experiences for staff and students in further/higher education settings. The paper first presents a pilot study that was used to assess the feasibility and acceptance of University teaching staff of embedding interactive GBL into a higher education environment. The authors then present the escapED theoretical framework that was used to create the prototype game for the pilot study as a tool to aid future design and development of on-site interactive experiences. The paper also presents an external developer report of using the escapED framework to develop a prototype game for teaching research methods to Southampton University students. Finally, the authors present a discussion on the use of the escapED framework so far and plans for future work and evaluation in order to provide engaging alternatives for learning and soft skills development amongst higher education staff and students.},

This need is important in the field of safe driving, where the driver should keep his attention to specific situations and decide the upcoming maneuvers.

	abstract = {Games are a part of human life since ancient times, present not only at childhood but throughout most of our adult life. A growing area of research focuses on the development of games for teaching and learning in various areas of expertise. These are called serious games. They intend to capture the attention, to motivate and to encourage user engagement through the use of recreational and entertainment elements, thus facilitating the learning process. This article describes iLearnTest, a framework for developing serious online games which are capable of supporting education of several subjects, allowing for a suitable training of participants, thus preparing them to meet the job market needs. This paper describes the architecture of the framework, the structure of the game and presents some results from performed experiments as to validate the overall approach.},

Its educational effectiveness is expected to be shown after school students get involved in formal programming lessons using LOGO or other languages. It is emphasized that students need an introductory level for programming based on their intuitive knowledge before getting involved with algorithmic concepts using formal programming tools. This paper outlines an approach for: A) Using a subset of LOGO language in a 3D environment, B) Propose an alternative method for pre-programming education and C) Design a Serious Games application to address all of the above. Usability evaluation results are discussed in later sections. While the enduser evaluation is still in progress, the Expert Review Method was used for initial evaluation based on a set of heuristics for game usability, game play and educational effectiveness.},

We first review the origins of the “Serious Games” oxymoron. We will then analyse digital games designed for serious purposes before the 2000’s. Such games can be traced back to the beginning of the history of video games. We will use all these elements to discuss how the current wave of “Serious Games” began; and to highlight the differences between “Serious Games” and their ancestors.},
